Set up this Zim notebook. At first I was not keen on it, but I have come to like it in the last hour. I have been messing around on the settings and preferences, it seems really powerful for my own organization. I realized this morning that I should document all my ideas, but I went further and decided I would make a wiki. Zim seems like exactly what I want. Tags, Journal, Wiki, Tasks... This will keep me organized, if it can't then nothing else can. I will write in this journal from now on, every day. 

In terms of the actual game, I fiddled around on the environment a bit, and reorganized all of the folders and resources. Happy with my day.
