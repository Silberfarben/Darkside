There are nine playable classes, which NPCs follow closely. Each class plays a role in the world, they are chosen at the beginning of the game by choosing between three [[Devotions]] & [[Dedications|Dedications.]]
The classes each have an associated **functional class name**, **animal**, and **lore name**.
They also receive their own skill trees which stem from a single root and branching into three branches with three abilities. 
The functional names of the classes are based on their chosen [[Devotions|Devotion]] and [[Dedications|Dedication]]
